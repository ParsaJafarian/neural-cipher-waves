# NCPS (Neural Network - Cipher - Physics - Simulation)

## How to get started
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the repository in your favorite IDE
3. Run the Main.java file

## Introduction
NCPS is a collection of mathematical/scientific simulations that teach users three different subjects. These simulations and their related subjects are:
* Neural Networks - Simulation that shows how neural networks predict patterns differently when given different hyper-parameters
* Classical Caesar Cipher - Implementation of one of the first crypotgraphy algorithms
* Physics (Waves) - Demonstration of simple harmonic motion through a spring, pendulum and wave
