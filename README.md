# NCPS (Neural Network - Cipher - Physics - Simulation)

## How to get started

1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/ParsaJafarian/neural-cipher-waves.git`
2. Open the repository in your favorite IDE
3. Run the Main.java file

## Introduction
NCPS is a collection of mathematical/scientific simulations that teach users three different subjects. These simulations and their related subjects are:
* Neural Networks - Simulation that shows how neural networks predict patterns differently when given different hyper-parameters
* Classical Caesar Cipher - Implementation of one of the first crypotgraphy algorithms
* Physics (Waves) - Demonstration of simple harmonic motion through a spring, pendulum and wave

## Neural Network

### Features
- *Hyper-parameters:* Customize learning rate, activation and loss functions to fine tune the model
- *Loss vs Epoch graph:* Visualize training progress by plotting loss over epochs
- *Optimizer:* Used Stochastic Gradient Descent Optimizer $O(n^2)$ which uses backpropagation and feedforward algorithms
- *Algorithms:* Feedforward $O(n)$ & Backpropagation algorithms. Activations were fed forward; Derivatives of weights & biases were found through backpropagating.
- *Entering custom data:* User writes input and output data. The model takes in the input data and tries to predict the output data.
